# 🎲 Random Winning Numbers Summation

## 📌 Project Overview
This project reads a text file (`problem.txt`), extracts **winning numbers** from multiple "Card" entries, and then **randomly sums** a subset of those numbers.
All of codes are based on **Procedural Paradigm** and I'll add more paradigms soon.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Reads and parses `problem.txt` to extract winning numbers.  
✅ Stores **all** winning numbers from all cards.  
✅ **Randomly selects and sums** a subset of winning numbers.  
✅ Uses **synchronous file reading** for reliability.  
✅ Implements **Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm** for randomness.
